# Summer project (shooter game)
Just a coding project we're doing during the summer.

## Guidelines
<p>I made a Jira board to keep track of what we want to do. Contact AlexWooz to receive an invite.</p>
<p>When working on a feature, create an issue on Jira assigned to yourself and create a separate branch from "master" starting with the issue ID. When ready to merge, make a pull request.</p>

## Setup
<p>Install the latest LTS version of Unity (2021.3.5f1 as of editing this) and clone this repository.</p>

## Contributors
<ul>
  <li>AlexWooz - Repository owner & developer</li>
