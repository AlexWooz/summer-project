# Summer project (shooter game)
Just a coding project we're doing during the summer.

## Guidelines
<p>I made a Jira board to keep track of what we want to do. Contact AlexWooz to receive an invite.</p>
<p>When working on a feature, create an issue on Jira assigned to yourself and create a separate branch from "master" starting with the issue ID. I don't want to say that pull requests are necessary, but it's good practice.</p>
